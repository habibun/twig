{# Using Multiple Blocks #}
{# If we refresh, the title is blank. But now, we can add a title block to our homepage: #}
{% block title %}50% off of Bow Ties{% endblock %}

{# If you want to add to the content of the parent block instead of completely replacing it, use the parent function: #}
{% block title %}
    Contact us | {{ parent() }}
{% endblock %}
